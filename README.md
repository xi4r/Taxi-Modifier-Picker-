Modifer Picker for Anime Vanguards Paragon

Pressing confirm immediately starts it, press F1 to stop it.

Recommended for people on high paragon floors (So you don't waste time clicking every modifier) and for people on lower floors (To AFK macro the way up).

Watch this youtube video if you don't understand how to AFK macro paragons using it: https://youtu.be/BFzIzX9JoJg

Choose the right settings, and it should work! Open a ticket in the discord if you're having issues.
